Example Description

This example describes how to use GPIO read/write mbed api to generate a pulse and to measure the pulse width.

Requirement Components:
    a wire

Pin name PA_12 and PA_5 map to GPIOA_12 and GPIOA_5:
 - PA_12 as the interrupt GPIO pin with no pull (High-Z).
 - PA_5 as output to generate a pulse.
 - Use a wire to connect PA_12 and PA_5

In this example, the UART consol will print out the measured width (in us) of the pulse which generated by PA_5.
